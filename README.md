map-generator
=============

Fantasy book style map generator

Dependencies
------------

map-generator uses:
* OpenCV 2.5.4 (http://opencv.org/)

Environment
-----------

Some of the make parameters depend on environment. To build the project succesfully you have to create these .mk files in make/ directory:
* external.mk
* scripts.mk
* sys.mk

An example is given for all those files, preceeded by an underscore (\_)

This system will be replaced with an automatic Makefile generation in the future.
